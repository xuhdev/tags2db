Tags2db is a program that converts tags files (ctags, gccxml, etc.) to database
tables (sqlite3, etc.). Currently only ctags and sqlite3 are supported. Other
tags files such as etags, and other databases such as MySQL will be supported
in the future.

1. Installation

To build and install it, First install sqlite3 development packages. On
Debian, you could do this by executing the following command:

# aptitude install libsqlite3-dev

If you are using a source tarball, then extract it:

$ tar zxvf tags2db-{version}.tar.gz
$ cd tags2db-{version}

Or you obtained the source code through the git repository, run ./autogen.sh:

$ cd /path/to/source/dir
$ ./autogen.sh

Run ./configure and make:

$ ./configure
$ make

You could also run "./configure --help" to see more compilation arguments
before run "./configure".

Now the binary executables should be built. To install it, run the following
command:

$ su -c 'make install'

This command requires root privilege.


2. Usage

Run "tags2db --help" to see how to use it:

$ tags2db --help
